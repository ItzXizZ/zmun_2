        <h3 style="color:var(--color-blue)">Code of Conduct</h3>
      </div>
      <p>BCMUN is dedicated to fostering a positive and fruitful academic atmosphere for every attendee. As a participant in BCMUN, you are expected to adhere to the regulations outlined in our Code of Conduct. Any violation of these regulations may lead to disciplinary measures, such as an apology, a suspension of speaking privileges, or an expulsion from the conference. If you have any inquiries, please contact the Secretary-General, Michael Xie. (Email can be found under the “contact” page.)</p>
      
      <h4>Discrimination</h4>
      <p>At BCMUN, all attendees must adhere to federal and provincial laws that prohibit discriminatory behavior. It is strictly forbidden for any participant, whether it be a delegate, staff member, faculty advisors, or any other individual within the conference premises, to engage in discrimination or harassment based on race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, genetic characteristics, disability, creed, or religious belief. BCMUN stresses the importance of mutual respect and acceptance of different viewpoints; delegates are reminded to refrain from using abusive or defamatory language or resorting to personal attacks.</p>

      <h4>Gender-based Violence</h4>
      <p>BCMUN maintains a strictly enforced policy of zero-tolerance towards sexual harassment, assault, and discrimination. Any individual who has witnessed or experienced such inappropriate conduct is urged to immediately report the incident to the Secretariat team. Failure to comply with this policy will result in immediate disciplinary measures, including verbal reprimand, expulsion from the conference, or any other necessary actions.</h4>

      <h4>Integrity</h4>
      <p>BCMUN expects all delegates to exhibit professionalism and courtesy in their demeanor, choice of language, and overall attire. This entails wearing suitable clothing for committee meetings and other BCMUN functions</p>

      <h4>Wifi Policy</h4>
      <p>At BCMUN, we believe that pre-conference research is a vital component of the MUN experience. We have a strict no-wifi policy during the conference in order to encourage delegates to conduct research beforehand and develop their public speaking skills. We recommend that all participants complete research on their respective topics prior to the conference so that they can actively contribute to discussions and gain a better understanding of the world around them. We hope that our no-wifi policy will inspire delegates to delve deeper into their assigned topics and engage in productive dialogue with their fellow participants.</p>

      <h4>Plagiarism</h4>
      <p>At BCMUN, we believe in upholding academic integrity and, therefore, we have a strict policy against plagiarism. All delegates are required to submit original work and properly cite any outside sources they use. We believe that plagiarism undermines the values of our conference and impedes the development of critical thinking and research skills that are essential for the MUN experience. Any delegate found guilty of plagiarism will face severe consequences. We want to ensure that all participants have a fair and equal opportunity to engage in stimulating discussions and debates, and plagiarism is not conducive to achieving this goal.</p>

        <h3 style="color:var(--color-blue)">Awards</h3>
      </div>
      <h4>Delegate Awards</h4>
      <p>There are four types of awards available for delegates to receive. Please note that exactly one of each award will be given in every single  committee. The awards are as follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Best delegate</li>
        <li>Outstanding delegate</li>
        <li>Honorable mention</li>
        <li>Best position paper</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order to be eligible for any award, delegates must submit a position paper to their directors by the deadline. Moreover, delegates found to have violated the BCMUN Code of Conducts will be disqualified from award consideration.</p>

      <h4>Delegation Awards</h4>
      <p>BCMUN offers a number of awards to delegations that commend the overall performance by a school delegation. The awards are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Best small delegation</li>
        <li>Best large delegation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A small delegation is defined as a group having less than 15 delegates. A large delegation is defined as a group having 15 or more delegates.</p>
      <p>Points for each award received by delegates will be awarded to their school delegations. Best position papers earn 1 point, honorable mentions earn 2 points, outstanding delegates earn 3 points, and best delegates earn 5 points for their delegation. Points for each delegation will be added up by the secretariat team and awards will be issued to the winning school delegations.</p>
